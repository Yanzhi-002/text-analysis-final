This project analyzes how public sentiment evolves over time in YouTube comment sections under AI fear–related videos. Using the YouTube Data API, I collected metadata and timestamped comments from 60 videos containing fear-oriented AI narratives. I then applied VADER sentiment analysis to examine comment-level emotional trends, with particular focus on three questions: whether sentiment shifts over time, whether early comments influence later ones, and whether these videos exhibit negative emotional echo chambers. Time-series plots and early-vs-late comparisons reveal clear negative sentiment drift and clustering, suggesting the presence of emotional contagion and fear amplification in AI-related discourse. This project demonstrates how online emotional dynamics can shape public perceptions of emerging technologies and highlights the importance of platform policies in managing high-emotion content.
